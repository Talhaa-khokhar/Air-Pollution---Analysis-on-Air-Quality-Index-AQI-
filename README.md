# Air-Pollution---Analysis-on-Air-Quality-Index-AQI-
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze air pollution levels by studying the Air Quality Index (AQI) data. 
Using data science techniques, we will perform data collection, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the factors contributing to air pollution. 
The insights derived from this project will help policymakers, environmentalists, and the public make informed decisions to improve air quality.
